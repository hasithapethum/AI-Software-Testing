Project Title

## Overview

This project comprises defect prediction and smart test selection mechanisms implemented within a continuous integration pipeline. The aim is to enhance code quality, optimize testing, and improve overall software development efficiency.

## Defect Prediction

### Approach

The defect prediction module employs machine learning models to predict potential defects within the codebase. 

### Data

The defect prediction model is trained on a dataset ('defect_prediction_data.csv') containing features such as 'Timestamp', 'Reported_Defects', 'Complexity_Metric', 'Time_Since_Last_Change', and 'Code_Changes'.

### Implementation

The 'defect_prediction.py' script loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, selects relevant features, builds and evaluates machine learning models for defect prediction, and fine-tunes the best-performing model.

## Smart Test Selection

### Approach

The smart test selection mechanism utilizes historical test execution data, code coverage reports, and code changes to intelligently select tests for execution based on efficiency and coverage criteria.

### Data

The smart test selection module fetches data from the version control system (Git), test execution logs, and code coverage reports.

### Implementation

The 'smart_test_selector.py' script implements functions to retrieve code changes, test execution logs, and code coverage reports. It preprocesses the data, merges different sources, applies test selection criteria based on efficiency and coverage, and outputs the selected tests.

## Usage

### Defect Prediction

To run defect prediction:
1. Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.
2. Execute 'defect_prediction.py'.

### Smart Test Selection

To use smart test selection:
1. Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.
2. Execute 'smart_test_selector.py'.

## Data

The 'defect_prediction_data.csv' file contains the dataset used for defect prediction.
